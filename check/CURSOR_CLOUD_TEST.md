# Native Cursor Cloud environment Build evidence

This file records native Cursor Build evidence only. It does not claim that the
separate Morpho proof task succeeded.

## Environment and initial Build

- Environment: `9e913d70-be66-11f1-bb68-864e54d14197`
- Initial environment version: `9fb5caa8-be66-11f1-bb68-864e54d14197`
- Initial recurring Build: `bld-20261002-a309b12f-e20a-4989-8968-d2781a34df2f`
- Build environment version: `2021262`
- Created/completed: `2026-10-02T13:39:01.835Z` /
  `2026-10-02T13:41:20.796Z`
- Cursor status: `SUCCEEDED`, but environment acceptance: **failed**

The complete native Build log shows that Cursor cloned `origin/master`, then ran
only Cursor's system setup commands. It never started a Docker build, never ran
`scripts/setup.sh`, and never mentioned Lean, Lake, Verity, solc, or either
Midnight module. An agent booted from this Build had no
`/etc/morpho-proof-environment`, `lean`, or `lake`.

Root cause: `.cursor/environment.json`, `.cursor/Dockerfile`, and
`scripts/setup.sh` existed only on `cursor/proof-sandbox`; Cursor's first
recurring Build prepared the repository default branch (`master`), where those
files did not exist. The Build's `SUCCEEDED` status therefore meant only that
the default Cursor image was snapshotted successfully.

## First branch-ref draft Build

- Draft Build: `bld-20261002-a419557b-8e05-4994-ace0-d9a7ef83249f`
- Build environment version: `2021263`
- Source/trigger: `AGENT` / `MANUAL`
- Created/completed: `2026-10-02T13:40:23.049Z` /
  `2026-10-02T13:48:58.879Z`
- Status: `SUCCEEDED`

This native Build used the feature-branch repository configuration. Its complete
log records:

- `Started: Docker build` and `Docker build completed` with exit code 0.
- Lean `4.31.0` and Lake `5.0.0`, installed by `.cursor/Dockerfile`.
- Docker step 6 writing `morpho-lean-v4.31.0` to
  `/etc/morpho-proof-environment`.
- Verity checked out at
  `9b472a8a48a9990337845f1720a20f374fa1e9cd`.
- Checksum-pinned solc `0.8.34+commit.80d5c536` installed at
  `.lake/solidity-import/solc-0.8.34`.
- `Built Midnight.Import`, `Built Midnight.Spec`, and
  `Build completed successfully (38 jobs)`.
- Install exit code 0 and a ready snapshot.

Cursor logged `Warming skipped (draft)`. This proves the native image and
install, but the draft was not the active Build used by new agents.

## Hardened retest

`scripts/setup.sh` now explicitly rejects a Build unless the Docker image marker,
the exact Verity revision, and solc `0.8.34+commit.80d5c536` are present. The
native retest Build ID, final status, and log evidence are appended after that
Build completes.

## Local diagnostics tooling validation

Input branch `cursor/proof-sandbox` adds pinned lean-lsp-mcp 0.31.0 and pinned
Python dependencies, a stdio wrapper, and Cursor IDE configuration. Local setup,
`sh scripts/doctor.sh`, and the MCP smoke test all pass with Lean 4.31.0.
The smoke test checked `Midnight/Spec.lean` (zero errors), detected the unsolved
`n + 0 = n` goal in a temporary example, and retrieved that goal through MCP.
This validates the Lean diagnostic tools locally; it does not certify that a
personal/team Cloud MCP server has been enabled.

The current input branch also checks image readiness during Cursor install and
startup. Its environment config validates against Cursor's published JSON schema.
Activation and a fresh-run boot check are still required before claiming that
new agents automatically start in the ready environment.
